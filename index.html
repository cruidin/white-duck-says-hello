            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <p>White Duck has been learning some new JavaScript tricks and he wants
              to show them to you.
              <br>
              Whenever you see this icon <img class="white-duck-icon"
              src="./assets/images/white-duck-quacks.png"
              alt=""> you can click on it and see what happens! But be aware: he might be disguised!
              <br><br>
              List of tricks:
              <br><br>
              1 - Click on the logo to change the background colour. Click on it again
              for a different colour. And again, and again...
              <br><br>
              2 - Click on any of the White Duck pictures in the first box for more
              content.
              <br><br>
              3 - Click on the White Duck picture in the second box for a random story
              featuring White Duck.
              <br><br>
              4 - Click on the little White Duck picture at the bottom of the page
              to randomly see all the different White Duck costumes.

            <h4>Mermaid</h4>
            <p>One day I went to the beach. I had a lovely time and did a lot of
              splashing in the sea. When I was about to leave I spotted her.
              Who's her, you might be wondering. Well, the mermaid, of course.
              I thought she looked fabulous in her shimmering scales. And her
              singing was beautiful but I confess it did make me a bit dizzy.
              Anyway, the day after I decided I wanted to be a mermaid for a day.
              I made sure to take lots of pictures of me as a mermaid, of course.
              Here are some of my favourite shots:
              <br>
              <br>
              <img class="white-duck-icon"

              src="./assets/images/white-duck-mermaid2.png"
              alt="">
              <br>
              <br>
              Do you think I look fabulous? Oh yes, you do!

            <h4>Winter</h4>
            <p>Well, it does get chilling sometimes, doesn't it. I went for a walk the other
              day. I put on my best wooly hat and scarf. But then it got really
              windy and the wind blew off my hat! Can you believe it? Well, happily
              I did manage to retrieve it with the help of a kind gentleman who was
              also chasing his own hat. I made sure I said thank you and then we
              had a little chat about the weather. The forecast had predicted that
              it was going to get really cold and even windier! And it did. So
              I was much more careful the next time.

              It's very sunny where I am now. So that's why I'm wearing sunglasses.
              You might be wondering why does a duck need sunglasses for? I tell you why.
              Because I do. Well, I don't really need sunglasses but why not? It's sunny, they

            <h4>Apple</h4>
            <p>Hey, watch out! I know I look tasty but I'm not actually an apple.
              What? Do you not recognise me? It's me, White Duck. I'm just dressed
              up as an apple for whatever reason. But I thought it looked pretty obvious
              that this is just an apple costume and not a real apple but what
              happened was that someone mistook me for an actual apple and took a bite
              off me! Nearly got my tail. And not only that, a maggot moved into my apple
              costume and decided to stay there!
