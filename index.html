            <h4>Mermaid</h4>
            <p>One day I went to the beach. I had a lovely time and did a lot of
              splashing in the sea. When I was about to leave I spotted her.
              Who's her, you might be wondering. Well, the mermaid, of course.
              I thought she looked fabulous in her shimmering scales. And her
              singing was beautiful but I confess it did make me a bit dizzy.
              Anyway, the day after I decided I wanted to be a mermaid for a day.
              I made sure to take lots of pictures of me as a mermaid, of course.
              Here are some of my favourite shots:
              <br>
              <br>
              <img id="white-duck-icon"

              src="./assets/images/white-duck-mermaid2.png"
              alt="">
              <br>
              <br>
              Do you think I look fabulous? Oh yes, you do!

              You might be wondering why does a duck need sunglasses for? I tell you why.
              Because I do. Well, I don't really need sunglasses but why not? It's sunny, they
