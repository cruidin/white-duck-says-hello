## Introduction </a>

White Duck Says Hello! is a humourous one page website about a duck who is learning JavaScript and wants to show off the new skills he can do.

The basic idea for this project is to tell stories through words and illustrations.

If time is on my side I intend to add a simple tarot/chance game. I intend to do that in a very simple way: click and generate a random card which will display an illustration and a text for the card.

Because I have been struggling to understand JavaScript I decided to keep it simple and try to make the most of it.

It comprises of 4 different sections.

This project was conceived as a response to our JavaScript Essentials Porfolio 2 project at The Code Institute for their Full Stack Web Development Program. It comprises of an interactive front-end website.
