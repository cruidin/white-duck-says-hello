The basic idea for this project is to tell stories through words and illustrations.

If time is on my side I intend to add a simple tarot/chance game. I intend to do that in a very simple way: click and generate a random card which will display an illustration and a text for the card.

Because I have been struggling to understand JavaScript I decided to keep it simple and try to make the most of it.

Again, all illustrations and texts are mine.
